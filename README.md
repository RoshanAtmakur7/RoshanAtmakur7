## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Software Test Engineer** and have completed my Bachelor's in **Computer Science & Engineering - Cybersecurity**. I'm passionate about security analysis, penetration testing, and exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment to build better defenses.

Let's connect and build something secure!
